## George Barrett

I am a dedicated and determined junior full stack developer that specialises in javascript and ruby (and a bit of python). I'm looking for a software development role where I can continually learn whilst contributing my existing skillset. 

Upon deciding to plunge into the world of coding in February 2022, I have been completely captivated by its nature and dedicated to improving. By June 2022 I had completed a front end development bootcamp. After this, I continued to teach myself until I found a position at a start-up that wanted to make finding tutors easy using a full stack web-app. This postion unfortunately ended in December 2022 due to the senior developer deciding to leave. From the start of 2023 I continued improving my skills independetly until February, when I earnt a position at one of the most selective and prestigious software development bootcamps, Makers. 

The most attractive element of tech for me is the oppotunity to continually improve. I find coding itself, problem-solving, logical thinking, team-working and using agile methods deeply rewarding and fulfilling, but continual improvement takes the biscuit. I haven't reached my potential with regards to a career, and tech offers me the opprunity to do something that I love, whilst seeing how far I can go. This for me is truly exciting.

## Skills

### Team-working
During my time working for Openbook (a start-up to help parents find tutors in their local area), I worked alongside a senior developer and another junior developer. It was crucial that we worked well as a team so that we could produce the full stack web-app using agile methods. The development team held regular meetings and as a result we could assign tickets to the most suited developer for the task. At one time, the senior developer was having issues with the backend and was exploring other alternative architectures, which caused him to be very busy. In this period, I lead the weekly meetings and managed all the communication with the client so he had more time to resolve the back end issue. I also delegated tasks to the other junior developer who was more new to the scene.

### Communication
I demonstrated my communicative abilites whilst being involved in every aspect of a renewable energy start-up. At the company I managed two post grads, so clear and friendly communication with them was crucial for their development and support. I would be involved with daily meetings with the CEOs, which required active listening skills, innovating new ideas and directions and ensuring their company goals were communicated to the juniors and the site team. At one time, there was a commercial project that involved a huge solar array being installed on a warehouse roof. I saw the project through from the intial phone call with the customer to the certification process at the end. I consulted the client on the best possible renewable energy solution, assessed the building, designed the installation using a CAD programme, arranged the scaffolding, ordered the materials, created a work-sheet for the site team, provided the certification post intallation, and helped with the actual installation using my electrical experience. The feeling of managing and being part of a complex project from start to finish was immensley rewarding and a big achievement. This role greatly improved all the transferable skills needed in the periphery of being a software developer.  

### Problem-solving
There are many parallels between working as a developer and as a commercial/domstic electrician. Being an electrician requires problem-solving, logic, team-work, independent work, testing and fault-finding. These are all, somewhat ironically, vital elements of being a developer. Me and three other electricians installed the electrics for one of the best music venues in Bristol. During that install we encountered a problem where a socket ring (looped circuit) had been broken by some builders. The break could not be identified visually so I recommended working as a team to problem-solve our way out. I suggested using a process of elimination to work out which section of cable had been severed. Once the section of cable had been identified then we removed it from the circuit. We could not replace the cable so I suggested that we used two radial (non-looped circuits) instead of a ring circuit (loop). For the two circuits to be safe, i performed current-carrying-capacity calculations on the circuits so I could use the correct safety devices and adjust the fuse board. This resulted in all the sockets working, safety regulations still being met and a fast fix for a complicated problem.  

<!-- #### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic. -->

#### Skills and Achievements

- Whilst working at a youth centre, I successfully raised funding for a music studio and equipment. I set the studio up independently and taught the young people music-production, drums, rapping and cultural awareness through global music.

- I significantly contributed to the survival of a renewable energy company throughout the pandemic and at pooints ran the company.

- I set up a discord group for the students at my previous bootcamp to form a community. During my time at the bootcamp I frequently helped others that were struggling via video calls and engaged in paired programming during my spare time.

- I did a 7a+ outdoor sports climb that I am very proud of. To make it to the top without coming off required a lot of discipline, mental and psychological preparation, problem-solving and persistence.

- I taught myself Spanish in my free time. I keep a journal in Spanish as this is a very effective way of learning. Through journaling I learn the vocabulary relevant to my life and write about things that I would often talk about (this comes in especially useful when actually conversing). It is also a great opportunity to express myself in a different way and find new perspectives..

- I have completed the initial ruby and javascript courses on codecademy.

- I have read and completed every exercise from Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw

<!-- - I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.) -->

## Hobbies

I am a big fan of climbing, chess, cross-country running, surfing, reading, film, yoga, learning Spanish, djing and being a king of ping. Kings of ping is a very unique table tennis club where everyone wears outlandish clothes and there's decent music pumping out of some speakers. In complete honesty, my ultimate hobby is collecting memorable experiences.
